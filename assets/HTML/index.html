				<h2 class="title">About the Project</h2>
				<p><strong>LOD Gabriel García Márquez: A Journey Through Gabo’s World</strong> is a project that brings together both objects produced by Gabriel García Márquez and materials related to his figure, with the goal of building a Linked Open Data model to represent and visualize knowledge surrounding his legacy. In addition to documents created by the author, complementary archives are included that, although not produced by him, engage in a dialogue with his work and influence, and will be described in greater detail later.</p>
				<p>The project seeks to explore how García Márquez captured the complexity of Latin America and how his work continues to have a profound resonance on a global scale. His Caribbean identity, his critical perspective on Colombia, his commitment to Latin American unity, and his international projection as a literary and political figure are interwoven in this curatorial approach.</p>
				<p>Ten distinct elements related to Gabriel García Márquez were selected to create a cohesive narrative about the Colombian writer. Each item was carefully chosen for its relevance, diversity, and connection to different people, places, periods, and concepts in his life and work.</p>
				<p>Below are brief descriptions and links for further exploration of each element.</p>

						<h5>About Gabriel García Márquez</h5>
						<p>Gabriel García Márquez, born in Aracataca, Colombia, in 1927 and passed away in Mexico in 2014, was a writer, screenwriter, and journalist globally recognized for his work <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> and for being one of the central figures of the so-called Latin American Boom. His style, characterized by magical realism and a profound exploration of the history, identity, and memory of Colombia and Latin America, earned him the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1982, in recognition of his extensive and prolific literary career.</p>
						<p>For over sixty years of intellectual production, García Márquez—affectionately known as Gabo—published newspaper articles, short stories, novels, screenplays for film and television, prologues, letters, and contributions to various compilations. His works have been translated into more than forty languages and are read worldwide.</p>
						<p>Gabo’s childhood in his maternal grandparents’ home in Aracataca left a lasting mark on his literary imagination. His grandfather, a war veteran, told him political and social stories, such as the banana massacre; his grandmother, on the other hand, nurtured his world with fantastic tales. This blend of the real and the imaginary gave rise to a unique poetic style that runs throughout his work.</p>

				<h2 class="title margin-top">The solitude of Latin America</h2>
				<div class="blockquote-rotator">
					<blockquote>
						<p>Latin America neither wants, nor has any reason, to be a pawn without a will of its own; nor is it merely wishful thinking that its quest for independence and originality should become a Western aspiration. However, the navigational advances that have narrowed such distances between our Americas and Europe seem, conversely, to have accentuated our cultural remoteness. Why is the originality so readily granted us in literature so mistrustfully denied us in our difficult attempts at social change? Why think that the social justice sought by progressive Europeans for their own countries cannot also be a goal for Latin America, with different methods for dissimilar conditions?</p>
						<p>No: the immeasurable violence and pain of our history are the result of age-old inequities and untold bitterness, and not a conspiracy plotted three thousand leagues from our home. But many European leaders and thinkers have thought so, with the childishness of old-timers who have forgotten the fruitful excess of their youth as if it were impossible to find another destiny than to live at the mercy of the two great masters of the world. This, my friends, is the very scale of our solitude.</p>
						<cite><strong>Gabriel García Márquez</strong> &mdash; Nobel Lecture, 8 December, 1982</cite>
					</blockquote>
					<blockquote>
						<p>On a day like today, my master William Faulkner said, “I decline to accept the end of man”. I would fall unworthy of standing in this place that was his, if I were not fully aware that the colossal tragedy he refused to recognize thirty-two years ago is now, for the first time since the beginning of humanity, nothing more than a simple scientific possibility.</p>
						<p>Faced with this awesome reality that must have seemed a mere utopia through all of human time, we, the inventors of tales, who will believe anything, feel entitled to believe that it is not yet too late to engage in the creation of the opposite utopia. A new and sweeping utopia of life, where no one will be able to decide for others how they die, where love will prove true and happiness be possible, and where the races condemned to one hundred years of solitude will have, at last and forever, a second opportunity on earth.</p>
						<cite><strong>Gabriel García Márquez</strong> &mdash; Nobel Lecture, 8 December, 1982</cite>
